        <h1>Ratanpur</h1>
        <p>Mahamaya Devi. Situated at 25 km away from the city of Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh) on the Bilaspur-Ambikapur state highway, the Mandir and the relics of scores of ancillary temples, domes, palaces and forts, now rundown by the time and natural forces – seem to tell a story. Once the capital of the Kalchuri kings, Ratanpur has almost a millennium of history.</p>
