            <p>The history of the Indian state Madhya Pradesh is divided into three periods - the ancient period, the medieval period and modern period. During the ancient period, the region was dominated by the Nanda Empire, the Maurya Empire, and the Gupta Empire. The medieval period saw the rise of Rajput clans including the Paramara and Chandela clans, the latter is known for constructing the temples of Khajuraho. The Malwa Sultanate also ruled during this period. The modern period in Madhya Pradesh saw the rise of the Mughal and Maratha empires, and later, the British Empire.</p>

            <p>Among the various dynasties that ruled part or all of Madhya Pradesh between the 2nd century BCE and the end of the 10th century CE were the Shungas (c. 185-c. 73 BCE), who ruled in eastern Malwa, the Satavahanas (1st or 3rd century BCE-3rd century CE), the Shakas (2nd-4th century CE), and the Nagas (2nd-4th century CE). The whole of Madhya Pradesh lying north of the Narmada River formed part of the Gupta empire (4th-5th century CE) and was the scene of a power struggle against the nomadic Hephthalites (Hunas) and the Kalachuris, the latter of whom occupied part of Malwa but only for a brief period. Yashodharman was the Malwan king who defeated the Hephthalites in the 6th century. During the first part of the 7th century, Malwa was annexed by the emperor of northern India, Harsha (Harahavardhana).</p>
			<p>By the 10th century the Kalachuris had risen again to occupy eastern Madhya Pradesh, including the Narmada valley; their contemporaries were the Paramaras of Dhar in what is now the western region, the Kachwahas of Gwalior in the north, and the Chandelas of Khajuraho, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Jhansi. Later the Tomaras ruled at Gwalior, and the tribal Gonds ruled over several districts.</p>

            <p>Muslim invasion of the area began in the 11th century. The Hindu domains of Gwalior were incorporated into the Delhi sultanate in 1231 by the sultan Iltutmish. Later, in the early 14th century, the Khaljī sultans of Delhi overran Malwa, which was subsequently annexed into the Mughal Empire by Akbar (ruled 1556-1605), the greatest of the Mughal emperors. Maratha power extended into Malwa at the beginning of the 18th century, and a large part of what is now Madhya Pradesh had come under the control of an alliance of Maratha rulers—the Maratha confederacy—by 1760. With the defeat of the peshwas (hereditary Maratha chief ministers who centralized Maratha rule) in 1761, the Sindhia dynasty of Marathas was established at Gwalior in the north and the Holkar dynasty, also Maratha, at Indore in the southwest.</p>
			<p>In the early 19th century the area became increasingly agitated as Pindari robber bands, composed of horsemen formerly attached to armies of Maratha chiefs, began to raid towns and villages from their hideouts in central India. The Pindaris, who received the tacit protection of the Sindhia and Holkar dynasties, had formed these autonomous bands beginning in the late 18th century, when the Maratha confederacy was weakening from internal dissension and from the growing military presence of the British. By 1818 British armies were able to suppress not only the Pindaris but also the various Maratha dynasties. That year the Nerbudda (now Narmada) River and Saugor (now Sagar) territories, containing much of northern Madhya Pradesh (including Gwalior and Indore of the Sindhia and Holkar dynasties), were ceded to the emerging British Empire.</p>

			<p>When India became independent in 1947, the new states of Madhya Bharat and Vindhya Pradesh were carved out of the old Central India Agency. Three years later, in 1950, the Central Provinces and Berar was renamed Madhya Pradesh. With the States Reorganization Act of 1956, Madhya Pradesh was redistributed along linguistic lines. The act transferred the southern Marathi-speaking districts of Madhya Pradesh to the Bombay state (now in Maharashtra) and merged several Hindi-speaking areas—the states of Bhopal and Vindhya Pradesh, as well as most of Madhya Bharat—with Madhya Pradesh. In 2000 its eastern provinces became the state of Chhattisgarh.</p>
