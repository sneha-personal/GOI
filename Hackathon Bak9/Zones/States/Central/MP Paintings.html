  <p>It is a form of folk painting created by one of the oldest tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh called 'Meena'. The art is created on walls and floors of houses and usually done by women. This artistic form of illustration is considered a representation of good luck and a method to ward off evil spirits.

  <p>The Gond art reflects the belief that "viewing a good image begets good luck". This inherent belief led the Gonds to decorating their houses and the floors with traditional tattoos and motifs. However, Gondi art has since transposed onto paper and canvass with talented artists showcasing their skills. Language of the soul is expressed in the brilliant hues of Gondi art. The signature styles are the essence of this tribal art form and are intrinsically used to fill the surface of their decorative patterns and motifs.</p>

  <p>Sanjhi is asociated with a specific festival by the same name, which is celebrated by unmarried girls both in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Sanjhi is drawn on walls that are first plastered with fresh cow-dung. On this surface various motifs are made in bas-relief with cow-dung. These motifs are decorated with flowers, colourful and bright strips of paper and kharia (chalk solution). A new motif is drawn each day only to be scrapped off the next day.</p>
