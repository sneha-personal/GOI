            <p>Karnataka's pre-history goes back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, 
			hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state.
			Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between 
			ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley civilisation ca. 3300 BCE.</p>
			<p>Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka.
			Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise
			of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. 
			The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi; the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.</p>

            <p>At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the 
			emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture.
			The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, 
			Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), on the banks of the 
			Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved.
			The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.
			In 1537, Kempe Gowda I, a chieftain of the Vijayanagara Empire, widely held as the founder of modern Bangalore, built a fort and established 
			the area around it as Bengaluru Pete.</p>
			<p>In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation 
			of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota.
			The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; 
			it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century.
			The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points 
			of this style. During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa,
			while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, 
			Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.</p>
			<p>In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other powers.
			In the south, the Mysore Kingdom, a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent.With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, 
			Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan.
			To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, 
			the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799.
			The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj.</p>

            <p>As the "doctrine of lapse" gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma, Sangolli Rayanna 
			and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, Kitturu was taken 
			over by the British East India Company even before the doctrine was officially articulated by Lord Dalhousie in 1848.
			Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa, Bagalkot, Shorapur, Nargund and Dandeli. These rebellions which coincided with the 
			Indian Rebellion of 1857 were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others. </p>
			<p>By the late 19th century, the independence movement had gained momentum; Karnad Sadashiva Rao, Aluru Venkata Raya, S. Nijalingappa, 
			Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.
			After India's independence, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, allowed his kingdom's accession to India.
			In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. 
			Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement, Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras,
			Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. 
			The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, on 1 November 1973.
			In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, 
			played an important role in the development of Karnataka's strong manufacturing and industrial base.</p>
