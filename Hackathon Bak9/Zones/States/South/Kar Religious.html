        <p>The 12th-century Chennakesava Swamy Temple in Hassan is worthy of our list of the

		Empire rule and has been mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, remaining an important pilgrimage site in Vaishnavism.

        <h1>Hoysaleswara Temple</h1>
        <p>The 12th century capital of the Hoysala Empire, Halebidu does just that. 
		Home to a number of heritage monuments in Karnataka, the city is truly fascinating in every way. 
		Fining its mention on our list is, one of the finest examples of Hoysala architecture, Hoysaleswara Temple. 
		In fact the temple is acclaimed as ‘the supreme climax of Indian architceture’.
		Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the incredible Dravidian temple is known for carvings and sculptures that bring to 
		life the mythological deities of Indian culture. The metal like polishing must be seen to believe how even stones can 
		be greatest of treasures. </p>

        <h1>Badami Cave Temple</h1>
        <p>The four cave temples of Badami were built between the 6th and 7th centuries. 
		The first temple worships Lord Nataraja, while the second and third cave temples to Lord Vishnu and the fourth temple to Lord Mahavira,
		the founder of Jainism. Though the exteriors are simple, they have fascinating ornate interiors.
		There are more than 81 sculptures of Lord Nataraja, ‘the cosmic dancer’, amorous couples, deities of 
		Indian mythology and more. As Badami was the capital of Chalukyas for over 2 centuries, these are enthralling masterpieces.</p>
