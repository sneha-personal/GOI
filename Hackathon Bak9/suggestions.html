					<span class="popup"><b class="dropch">RAM LEELA MELA</b><br><br><p>Ram Leela is a dramatic folk re-enchantment of the life of Shree Ram. It is also commonly called as Ramayana. It is heavily based on the ancient Hindu epic Ramcharitmanas. Ramayana tells us the story of King Shree Ram, whose wife gets kidnapped by asur (demon) Ravana, who kidnaps her by hoax. After this, Shree Ram does everything possible, along with his brother, Lakshman and fellow mates, Hanuman, and his vanar sena, to get her wife back. Shree Ram is the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu and the central figure of the Ramayana, a Sanskrit epic that integrates performance arts with stories driven by ethical values.</p></span>

It is a "story play" genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up, costumes and face masks that the traditionally male actor-dancers wear. A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India, synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial arts and athletic traditions of South India.</p></span>

A typical Sadhya can have two to three dozen dishes. During the 10-day Onam festival, an elaborate Sadhya is prepared which perhaps is another big attraction of the festival. It is mostly served in lunch, on banana leaves and people sit cross-legged on the floor and eat it with their right hand. The dishes are served in a specific order and they also have their designated places on the banana leaf.</p></span>
